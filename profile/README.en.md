# WHY

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." — Richard Feynman

In the age of AI, this quote has become more piercing than ever before.

Today, models like Claude can already write world-class code and system designs:
operating systems, databases, compilers, distributed systems, machine learning frameworks...
Many things we never truly understood, AI can help us build in an instant.

This is both power and a certain sense of powerlessness.

- We're invoking massive black boxes;
- We rely on them to do more and more things;
- But we don't know what's happening inside these black boxes.

What I want to do is, in this era, to re-answer three questions:

1. **In the age of AI, what does it really mean to "understand" a computer science discipline?**
   Simply knowing how to use tools is no longer enough.
   I hope to at least be able to:
   - Know what AI is doing;
   - Know which fundamental structures, protocols, and architectures these capabilities depend on;
   - Know why these foundations exist and why they were constructed this way.

2. **In the age of AI, what should a "qualified" computer science curriculum teach?**
   When all students have a world-class AI assistant in their hands,
   the old curriculum of "teaching you to hand-write sorting algorithms and linked lists" seems too simple.
   The new questions become:

   - How deep should we really take students?
   - Which parts can be delegated to AI, and which parts must we walk through ourselves?
   - To what depth of understanding can we dare say "I truly understand this subject"?

3. **How do we leverage AI, not to simplify learning, but to deepen understanding?**
   I don't want to treat AI as a "shortcut to skip the hard parts,"
   but rather as a "mechanical arm that amplifies first-principles thinking."
   I hope:

   - I ask the questions, clarify assumptions, and design abstractions;
   - AI helps me push these abstractions to their limits through code and experimentation;
   - Ultimately producing a collection of from-scratch systems,
     which serve as tools, courses, and evidence of understanding.

Therefore, this project is not about "replicating traditional textbooks,"
but rather reconstructing a **first-principles-based infrastructure for computer science** in the age of AI:

- Using from-scratch systems to re-understand operating systems, databases, compilers, networks, distributed systems, machine learning, and search;
- Using human + AI collaboration to explore what "understanding" means in the 21st century;
- Along the way, providing a learning path for future CS learners that matches the AI era.

Simply put, in one sentence:

**I don't want to just know how to use tools.
I want to know how this world is built, so that even if one day it's just me and an AI, I can rebuild it from scratch.**
